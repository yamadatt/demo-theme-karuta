## Food and Coffee

Sea-to-table ceviche, Afro-Panamanian stews, and world-class coffee (including Geisha). Casco offers bakeries and rooftops; Boquete roasteries pour farm-to-cup.

## Getting Around and Safety

Use the metro and rideshares in the city; for highlands/islands, book transfers or fly regional. Mind sun and hydration; carry light rain gear year-round.
