Alaska is scale: long horizons, deep silence, and weather that writes the rules. This photo guide covers Denali, Kenai Fjords, glaciers, wildlife viewing, and road-trip rhythms.

## Wildlife and Seasons

Bears, moose, eagles, whales — read distance and respect space. Summer long days; winter brings auroras and crisp stars.

Layers, rain protection, spare fuel, and redundancy. Tell someone your plan; watch forecasts, winds, and rivers.
