DJing is curation and timing — the art of connecting records (or files), phrases, and people. This photo-driven primer covers culture, gear, beatmatching and phrasing, crate building, and how to shape a great night from warm-up to close.

## Culture and Role

The DJ steers energy, not just plays bangers. Respect the room, warm it properly, then lift — the crowd completes the mix.

## Gear Basics

- **Players:** Turntables, media players (CDJs), or controllers.
- **Mixer:** Clean gains, EQ sculpting, filters, FX.
- **Monitoring:** Headphones and booth monitors for precise cueing.
- **Software:** Library tags, beat grids, and recording.

## Beatmatching and Phrasing

Tempo match by ear or tools, align on 16s/32s, and use EQ to cross. Phrase in blocks and leave space for vocals and hooks.

## Crates and Selection

Tag by BPM, key, energy, and vibe. Build arcs — warm-up, lift, breather, peak, land — and carry backups for curveballs.

## Reading the Room

Watch feet and faces, not phones. Hold momentum with micro-adjustments; resist whiplash genre jumps unless it serves the story.

## Performance and Recording

Practice recording sets for honest feedback. Mind gain staging, keep headroom, and let transitions breathe.

## Quick Tips

- **Count bars:** Mix on 16/32s for clean phrasing.
- **Gain before EQ:** Avoid red; trust the PA.
- **Plan lightly:** Prepare crates, improvise the order.
- **Close with care:** Land energy so nights end smiling.

Great DJs serve the dancefloor first. Track by track, read and respond — that dialogue is the craft.
