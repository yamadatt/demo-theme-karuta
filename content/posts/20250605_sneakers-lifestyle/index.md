Sneakers move between performance and lifestyle — from tracks and courts to streets and runways. This photo-driven primer explores silhouettes, materials, care, and how to build a rotation that works every day.

## Silhouettes and Use Cases

- **Runners:** Lightweight, cushioned, all-day wear.
- **Court shoes:** Stable, flat, and versatile with denim.
- **Skate silhouettes:** Durable uppers and grippy soles.
- **High-tops / Mids:** Ankle coverage, bigger proportions.

## Materials and Construction

Leather, suede, canvas, mesh, knit — each ages and breathes differently. Midsole foams change ride; cupsole vs vulc changes boardfeel and durability.

## Color, Proportions, and Styling

Anchor outfits with neutral pairs; punctuate with one bold color. Balance chunky soles with wide trousers; slim runners with tapered hems.

## Care and Storage

Use shoe trees, rotate pairs, and brush suede dry. Spot-clean uppers; avoid high heat; store out of direct sun to reduce yellowing.

## Buying Smart

Focus on comfort and use; try true-to-size vs. half-up for width. Check returns, inspect glue lines, and read materials, not just model names.

## Build a Rotation

- **Daily beater:** Comfortable neutral pair.
- **Elevated white:** Clean leather/canvas.

## Quick Tips

- **Lace right:** Heel lock for runners; skip-eyelet to relieve instep.
- **Mind socks:** Material and thickness change fit.
- **Protect:** Spray suede/nubuck before first wear.
- **Rotate:** Uppers recover; midsoles last longer.
