## Kawaii, Decora, and Beyond

Think vibrant palettes, oversized bows, layered accessories, and character motifs. Decora-inspired looks pile on playful elements, while modern kawaii often mixes pastels with streetwear silhouettes and platform footwear for a sharper edge.

## Ura‑Hara Heritage Meets Now

The Ura‑Harajuku lineage—graphic tees, workwear, military surplus, and innovative cuts—still informs the scene. Contemporary labels remix those codes with technical fabrics, generous proportions, and bold art direction.

## Silhouette: Layer, Stack, Play

Layering is a design language here—stacked hems, visible underlayers, mixed textures, and unexpected lengths create dynamic proportions. The result is movement and personality in every step.

## Statement Footwear

Platforms, creepers, tech sneakers, and chunky boots all have a home in Harajuku. Shoes punctuate the look—adding height, attitude, and sometimes a pop of neon.

## Hair, Makeup, and Accessories as Art

Colorful hair, graphic liner, nail art, stickers, and layered jewelry complete the story. Beauty and accessories are treated as equally important design surfaces.
