## Genres and Gateways

Shōnen, shōjo, seinen, josei, isekai, mecha, sports, music — genres are tools, not boxes. Start with themes you enjoy: coming-of-age, mystery, romance, or found-family adventures.

## Visual Language

Silhouette clarity, color scripts, and expressive timing. Choreography uses speed lines, smears, holds, and impact frames; lighting and framing carry mood.

## From Board to Broadcast

Concept → script → storyboards → layouts → key animation → in-betweens → backgrounds → compositing → sound/music → final. Production balances schedule, budget, and the director’s vision.
