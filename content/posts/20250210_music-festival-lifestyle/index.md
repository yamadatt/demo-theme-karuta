Festivals are temporary cities built on sound and community. Between sunrise openers and headliner finales, it’s about pacing your energy, finding your people, and collecting little moments that last.

## Culture: Shared Energy, Shared Care

Festivals work when everyone looks out for each other. Respect staff, give space, lift someone’s dropped bottle — small kindness keeps the big vibe alive.

## Scheduling the Day

Anchor 2–3 must-see acts, then wander. Catch partial sets, leave early for headliners, and buffer time for water + rest.

## Safety and Wellness

Hydrate, eat, and find shade. Know med tents, set rendezvous points, and use ear protection to love music longer.

## Camping and Night Moves

Keep camp minimal and secure. After dark, stay with friends, charge devices, and carry a small light — save your legs for dancing.

## Capture Memories, Stay Present

Snap a few scenes, then pocket the phone. The best memories live in the moment between songs.
