## The Art of the Mix

Londoners are masters of the high-low mix, effortlessly pairing designer pieces with high-street finds and vintage treasures. There are no rules—only creativity. A tailored coat might be thrown over a band t-shirt, or a couture bag paired with battered trainers.

## A Nod to Heritage

British heritage fabrics and patterns are a constant source of inspiration. Think classic trench coats, tailored tweed, and punk-inspired tartan. These timeless elements are constantly being reinterpreted in new and exciting ways.

## Statement Outerwear

Given the city's unpredictable weather, it's no surprise that outerwear is a key focus. From classic camel coats to bold, oversized puffers, a great coat is a London essential. It's the piece that pulls the whole look together.

## The Trainer Is King

Comfort is key in a city that's always on the move. Trainers are ubiquitous, worn with everything from tailored trousers to floaty dresses. They add a touch of urban cool to any outfit.

## A Love of Tailoring

Whether it's a sharp suit from Savile Row or a perfectly cut blazer from the high street, Londoners appreciate good tailoring. The look is often relaxed and slightly undone, rather than stuffy or formal.

## Individuality and Attitude

More than any specific item of clothing, London street style is about attitude. It's about having the confidence to wear what you want, how you want. It's a celebration of personal style in all its forms.
