## A Melting Pot of Subcultures

Shibuya's style is not one single look, but a vibrant mix of numerous subcultures. From the dark, dramatic flair of visual kei to the cute, pastel-colored world of lolita fashion, and the oversized, layered look of modern streetwear, there's a niche for everyone. This diversity is what makes Shibuya so exciting.

## The Power of Layering

Layering is a key element of Tokyo street style. It's not just about warmth; it's a way to create complex, interesting silhouettes and to play with textures and proportions. A t-shirt might be worn over a long-sleeved shirt, under a vest, and topped with a jacket.

## Bold Graphics and Logos

Graphic t-shirts, hoodies, and jackets are a staple. Logos are worn proudly, and bold, eye-catching graphics are a way to make a statement and show allegiance to a particular brand or subculture.

## Sneakers and Statement Footwear

Sneakers are a huge part of Shibuya style, from the latest limited-edition drops to classic, retro models. But it's not just about sneakers; chunky platform shoes, boots, and other statement footwear are also common, adding height and drama to any outfit.

## Accessorizing to the Max

More is more when it comes to accessories in Shibuya. It's common to see people wearing multiple bags, layers of jewelry, hats, and elaborate hair accessories. Every detail is considered and contributes to the overall look.

## Hair and Makeup as Fashion

Hair and makeup are just as important as the clothes. Bold, colorful hair, dramatic eye makeup, and intricate nail art are all common forms of self-expression.
