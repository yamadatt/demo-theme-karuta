House music is a feeling — a communal pulse born from Chicago’s warehouses and carried worldwide through DJs, dancers, and late-night rooms. This photo-driven primer touches on where it comes from, how it’s built, and how to show up — on decks, in the booth, and on the floor.

## Roots and Culture

From Chicago and NYC to the world, house is built on inclusivity, joy, and movement. The DJ curates energy; the crowd completes the mix.

## Structure and Groove

Four-on-the-floor kicks, syncopated hats, rolling bass, and soulful textures. Typical tempo sits ~118–130 BPM; phrasing often in 4, 8, 16-bar blocks.

## DJ Basics: Blend, Phrase, Read

Match tempos, align phrases, and EQ with intention. Read the room — energy arcs > single drops. Record your sets and refine transitions.

## Production: From Loop to Track

Start with a drum loop, add a hook (chords, vocal, stab), then arrange with tension/release. Sidechain for space; leave headroom on the master.

Respect space, hydrate, and be kind. The best sets are a conversation — cheer the blends and give room to move.
