Krump is a raw, expressive street dance — a language of power, musicality, and story. It lives in sessions and battles, where characters (personas) and emotions drive movement. This photo-driven piece breaks down foundations, training methods, and the culture that keeps the scene alive.

## Origins and Culture

Born in early-2000s Los Angeles, Krump channeled energy into art: sessions, call-outs, and mentorship. Crews form fams; battles sharpen style and character.

## Character and Story

Build a persona (character) with a clear narrative — triumph, struggle, humor. Let intent lead shapes; use contrast (slow/fast, big/small) to reveal emotion.

## Music and Musicality

From heavy bass to chopped snares, listen for textures. Hit drums with pops, ride hi-hats with grooves, and breathe between accents.

## Training: Drills to Session

- **Power drills:** Reps of stomps, pops, and swings to build stamina.
- **Texture practice:** Vary weight and speed for nuance.
- **Session rounds:** Short timed rounds to simulate battles.

## Battling and Etiquette

Respect the space, bring your best, and let others shine. Clear call-outs, no contact, and celebrate wins with humility — the scene grows together.
