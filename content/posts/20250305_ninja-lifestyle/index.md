Ninja (shinobi) occupy a blurred line between history and legend. Beyond pop culture silhouettes lie networks, intel, and survival skills shaped by geography, politics, and necessity. This photo-forward guide touches on context, tools, training, and the mythos that persists.

## Context and Roles

Shinobi supported warlords with reconnaissance, infiltration, counter‑intel, and sabotage. Regions like Iga and Kōga are central in records and folklore.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Ropes/Climbing:** Access and escape across walls and terrain.
- **Disguise/Deception:** Dress the part; blend into crowds and trades.
- **Implements:** Kunai, shuriken, smoke, and firecraft — context over duel fantasy.

## Training and Discipline

Conditioning, balance, navigation, and observation were as critical as combat. Reading wind, water, and footsteps often outweighed force.

## Myth vs Reality

Sources mix manuals, anecdotes, and later fiction. Separate stage costume from practical dress; weigh claims against era and need.

## Landscapes and Hideaways

Mountain passes, forests, rivers, and castle towns shaped tactics — movement follows terrain and schedule.
